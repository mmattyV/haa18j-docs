# The Metabolists

* Designates group of 5 young architects, influenced by Tange, who focuses on the relationship between architecture and urbanism
* Authored a manifesto at the 1960 World Design Conference
* Although few "Metabolist" structures were completed, their ideas were very influential both domenstically and interantionally
* Understood cities as organisms with complex metabolisms and multiple temporalities
* ## Search for form
	* Golgi Structures
	* Helix cities
* An icon of the Metabolist movement
	* The Nakagin Capsule Tower
* ## The Capsule
	* Becomes international symbol of Metabolism
	* Influenced by "survival architecture," the minimal provisions of the bomb shelter
	* Also influenced by aerospace hardware
	* Biggest proponent was Kurokawa Kisho
	* Most used in shipbuilding
	* The capsule was a mini-universe (had everything you needed to live in a small space)

# 4 Post-Metabolist Approaches to the City in Japanese Architecture
* Anti-urbanism
* Digital urbanism
* Refugee urbanism
* Micro urbanism
* ## Anti-urbanism
	* Tadao Ando
	* Major Ando buildings in the US
	* ### Concrete Architecture (The Brutalist Movement)
		* Boston City Hall
		* Grittiness and industrialism
		* St. Mary's Cathedral
	* Ando's "Poetic Concrete"
		* Leaves seam lines and pores --> shows the artisanship of the materials
	* Attempting to shut out the city to create private cells of daily life
* ## Digital Urbanism
	* Light construction movement in architecture --> hiding load-bearing elements of the building --> increased sense of lightness
	* Horyuji Treasure Hall
	* Ito Toyo
	* Sendai Mediatheque
		* Mesh columns hold the building up
		* Like an aquarium
		* Torquing the columns led to more structural stability
		* Can't tell what is holding the building up
* ## Micro-urbanism
	* Atelier Bow-Wow (founded 1992)
		* Kaijima Momoyo
		* Tsukamoto Yoshiharu
	* The multi-layered city
		* Subway stations are mini-cities
	* Observed sharp juxtapositions in Japan's architecture
	* Lane life
		* Alleys between buildings form a communal space
	* Neon life
	* Oddly shaped buildings created from weird building policies and codes
* ## Refugee Urbanism
