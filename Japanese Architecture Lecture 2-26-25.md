# Temple of the Golden Pavilion (Kinkakuji)
* Ashikaga Yoshimitsu
* Completed 1397, 1955 (reconstruction)
* The reconstruction was heavily debated and several questions remain
	* How much gold was there on the outside?
	* Now currently sheathed in gold foil
	* Some experts believe gold should only cover the top floor
	* Old photos and premodern paintings depicting Kinkakuji are inconclusive
* ## Kamakura Period (1185-1333)
	* The rise of warrior rule after the Genpei War (1180-1185)
	* Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147-1199) defeats Taira clan, appointed shogun
	* Establishes shogunal capital at Kamakura in eastern Japan
	* Emperor and aristocracy remain intact Kyoto, although their authority becomes increasingly symbolic (shoguns wield actual power)
	* In 1189, Yoritomo defeats the Northern Fujiwara at their capital in Hiraizumi
	* In Kamakura, the Hojo regents assume power over the Minamoto
	* The rise of popular Pure Land sects and Zen Buddhism
	* The Northern Fujiwara:
		* Noble family that ruled at Hiraizumi (modern-day Iwate Prefecture) in NE Japan, conquered by Yoritomo in 1189
	* Kamakura: The Shogunal Capital
		* No old structures survive the shogunal capital of Kamakura, but evidence suggests that its major buildings emulated those of Kyoto, Nara, and Hiraizumi
	* The Great Buddha of Kamakura
	* Very few structures dating to the Kamakura period (1185-1333) survive in Kyoto (Hall of 33 Bays)
* ## Muromachi Period (1333-1573)
	* Emperor Godaigo (1288-1339) leads overthrow of Hojo family
	* Godaigo betrayed by the eastern warlord Ashikaga Takauji, who establishes new shogunate led by the Ashikaga warrior house in Kyoto
	* Imperial court split into Northern and Souther Courts (1336-1392)
	* Ashikaga embrace Zen Buddhism and establish palaces in the Muromachi district of Kyoto
	* Retirement villas for the shoguns (better to rule from retirement):
		* Third shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358-1408) builds Kitayama Villa, which includes Kinkakuji (1397), on northern outskirts of Kyoto
		* Eighth shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa (1436-1490) build Higashiyama Villa on the eastern outskirts of Kyoto
	* Only 3 buildings survive from these 2 shogunal villas
* ## The Kitayama Villa
	* From around 1000 CE, the Fujiwara regents began to build enormous palace-temple complexes where they conducted affairs of state away from the imperial city. When they died, these complexes were converted to mortuary temples
	* Similarly, during the late Heian period (late 11th through 12th centuries), powerful retired emperors began building enormous "retirement palaces" that were imperial cities themselves outside of the actual imperial cities
	* Locational Pedigree:
		* Kinkakuji was once part of the Kitayama Villa, built on the site of the former Saionji estate in northern Kyoto
		* Only surviving building of the retirement villas
	* Yoshimitsu's Kitayama Villa had no less than 3 shinden palaces and served as the de facto seat of government until his death in 1408. After his death the next shogun resided in the Muromachi Palace in Kyoto proper, and the entire Kitayama Villa was converted into a mortuary temple for Yoshimitsu known as Rokuonji
	* The Great Tower of Kitayama (Kitayama Daito)
		* In 1399, Yoshimitsu constructed a seven-story pagoda at the Zen monastery Shokokuji
		* The pagoda was destroyed by lightning in 1403, after which Yoshimitsu began rebuilding at the Kitayama Villa
		* When Yoshimitsu died in 1408, the tower was nearly complete, but it too was destroyed by lightning in 1416
		* The seven-story pagoda was 110 meters tall
	* The Golden Hall at Hiraizumi is sheathed with gold foil, only known example of golden structure before Kinkakuji
	* Why Gold?:
		* Precedent of Chusonji Golden Hall?
		* Religious symbolism
		* Visitation by Emperor Gokomatsu (1408)
		* Reception of foreign embassies from Korea (1403) and China (1405-1407)
	* "King of Japan"
		* Kinkakuji reflects new ideal of rulership within both a domestic and international context
* ## Multi-Floor Architecture
	* Multi-story buildings in early Japan
		* Upper stories are usually elaborate trusses that are not inhabitable
		* Fake upper floors
		* Why didn't they build real floors?
			* Limitations to architectural knowledge initially
			* Not much of a need
	* The multi-floor lakeside pavilion enters Japan along with Zen monasteries in the 13th century
	* During the 14th century, the Japanese Zen monk Muso Soseki (1275-1351) built 2 important Zen temples, which exerted influence on Kinkakuji (and its multiple floors)
* ## Kinkakuji's Three Floors
	* Each floor is stylistically distinct
	* 1: Shinden palace architecutre
	* 2: Japanese style
	* 3: Zen style
	* Phoenix finial reflects influence of aristocratic temples
	* First floor (Ablution Hall)
		* 5x4 bays with insertion of "long bay" in facade
		* Shinden style architecture
		* No walls between south pillars
		* Presence of reticulated shutters on south side recalls shinden architecture (unobstructed views onto the water and garden)
	* Second floor (Tide Sound Cavern)
		* 5x4 bays (same as first)
		* "Japanese Style" with balcony
	* Third floor (Peak of the Realm of Perfection)
		* 3x3 bay with balcony
		* Zen style
		* Originally housed a buddhist relic
		* Simple construction:
			* Wood shingle roofs
			* One-step brackets
	* Ornamental nosings
* ## Why so Eclectic?
	* The first floor in the shinden style is continuous with the three shinden palaces on the premises of the Kitayama Villa. It occupies a position that a "fishing pavilion" would have for a traditional shinden palace
	* The shingled, pyramidal rood and phoenix finial reflect aristocratic power
	* The upper 2 floors recall the Chinese-style multi-story lakeside pavilions that came to be built within Japanese Zen monasteries
		* Set of temple halls built on top of shinden architecture
	* Since Heian period, retirement villas of emperors converted into mortuary temples upon death. Kinkakuji may be have been designed to accommodate this conversion --> eclecticism designed to anticipate evolving usage and meaning of the structure
	* **Architectural Legacy of Kinkakuji and Kitayama Villa**
		* Last hurrah of shinden architecture
		* Earliest surviving multi-story building
		* Retirement villa as site of statecraft
		* Organic layout of villa on uneven terrain surrounding water (Katsura)
		* Influence on castle design (Azuchi): eclecticism and gold
* ## Future
	* The emergence of shoin architecture
