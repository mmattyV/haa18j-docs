# Errata
* Onbashira ("Pillar") Festival
	* Suwa Grand Shrine, Nagano Prefecture
	* 4 corner pillars of the shrine raised
	* Form of renewal
# Advanced Timber-Frame Architecture

## Origins
* Chinese, East Han Dynasty (25-220 CE)
* Example:
	* Tomb Furnishing in the Form of a Three-Storied Watchtower --> needs advanced timber-frame support
* Brought to Japan in the 6th century
	* Asukadera (Japan's oldest temple), complete in 596 CE --> advanced timber-frame architecture comes into Japan fully formed
## Transmission to Japan
* Comes from Korean Peninsula in the 6th century
* Korean master carpenters probably helped build Asukadera
## Four Zones of a Timber-Frame Building
1. **Foundation**
	1. Needed before anything (wooden skeleton) is erected
	2. *Rammed-earth foundation* faced with granite stone
		1. Foundation made with layers of hard-packed dirt mixed with gravel and plaster
		2. Needs to be strong to support the heavy structure
		3. Foundation lays on top of topsoil --> softer topsoil allows movement to absorb seismic shock
		4. Foundation stones inserted to directly support the pillars
		5. Sometimes faced with a double layer of granite stone slabs
		6. Sometimes floors are just dirt without covering
	3. Foundation stones usually recycled when a building goes to ruin
		1. Usually has circular indentation to fit the pillar better
2. **Pillars**
	1. Determine the # of bays in a building (internal layout)
	2. 1 bay = 6 *shaku* (roughly 6 feet)
	3. In 1875, this was fixed at 181.8 cm
	4. The Organization of Internal Space: Moya and Hisashi
		1. Moya: Core space
			1. Space encompassed by pillars
			2. Can have multiple perimeters of pillars
		2. Hisashi: Corridor-like space
			1. Usually 1 bay wide
			2. Space between the perimeters of pillars
		3. Constructs space radially
	5. Mokoshi: pent roof
		1. Roof that's inserted directly into the columns but not supported by a bracket set
		2. Creates second covered space outside of the hisashi
	6. Can fill in any space between the pillars to organize the layout differently
	7. Most of the pillars are originally painted
		1. Usually a deep red color
			1. Symbolizes power and authority
3. **Bracket Sets**
	1. Timber frame components that lie on top of the columns
	2. Mechanism that transfers weight of a horizontal components above it to a vertical component below
	3. Blocks and arms
		1. Blocks support brackets that support horizontal and vertical beams that converge on top of a column
		2. Kind of like a traffic intersection
	4. Functional and aesthetic purpose
	5. Brackets usually have elbows (beveled)
	6. Eaves that extend beyond the walls are supported by protruding bracket sets
	7. Can have multiple steps of brackets
		1. Steps = number of elbows that are load bearing
		2. Tail rafter (rafter that pokes out of the building) counts as a step
		3. Three-step is most common
	8. Intercolumnar struts
		1. Support beams that lie between columns
		2. Used for extra support on the beams between the pillars
		3. Usually ornamental
4. **The Roof**
	1. Truss
		1. Basic wooden skeleton of the roof
		2. On top of which mud and tiles are applied
		3. Triangular skeleton that lies on top of the bracket sets
		4. *Ridgepole:* beam that lies at the apex of the roof
			1. Symbolic meaning
			2. Ridgepole raising ceremonies and rituals
			3. Usually adorned with a plaque containing the metadata about the building
		5. Ceilings usually hide the roof structure from below (seen as unseemly)
		6. Rafters sit perpendicular to the main roof beams (extend towards the eaves)
			1. Construct the plane of the roof skeleton
		7. Flying rafters bend upwards to lift up the edges of the building
			1. Provide he signature curve
	2. Forms:
		1. *Gable* - 2 planes that meet at the ridgepole
		2. *Hip* - 4 planes that construct the roof; ridgepole is shorter than distance of facade of the building; 4 lines extend diagonally from the ridgepole
		3. Hip-And-Gable - hip begins at the edge of the gable and extends beyond; ridgepole also shorter than distance of facade of the building
			1. Usually delineate the internal structure as well (where pillars and moya are)
		4. Pyramidal - 4 planes; meet at point instead of a line; no ridgepole
		5. Can have double forms well
		6. Can be thought of as ratio of ridgepole to facade of building
	3. Materials:
		1. Thatch
		2. Shingle (Bark or Wood) - very prestigious; taken in a way that doesn't kill the tree
			1. Better protection than thatch
		3. Tile
			1. 15 kg per tile
			2. Usually reroofed piecemeal
			3. Endure time longer than other pieces of the building
	4. Demon tiles at the corners ward off evil spirits
	5. Eave-end tiles
		1. Can mark function of the building
		2. Coat of arms of the patron
	6. Ridgepole ornaments
		1. Important status symbols
## Major Characteristics
1. Grand appearance
	1. Grand tiled roof
	2. Sweeping curves
	3. Eaves extend beyond the walls
2. Protection
	1. Tiled roof
	2. Foundation stones
	3. Painted pillars
	4. Extended eaves
	5. Protect wooden frame better from the elements
3. No walls
	1. Tradition without load-bearing walls
	2. Load-bearing pillars instead
	3. Walls are there to fill space instead of support
4. Spanning
	1. Uninterrupted spans of open space in the interior of the building
	2. Funneling of weight to outer columns allow them to have open space
		1. Less internal support pillars need to be used
	3. Usually spanned from front to back
5. Interregional
	1. Found across East Asia in Korea and China
6. Flexible Program
	1. Based on radial construction of space
	2. Comes from Buddhism
	3. Can be used for palaces and temples (moya can be used for throne or statue)
## Horyuji Monastery, Nara
* Late 7th century
* Oldest surviving timber frame building in Japan
* The Golden Hall (Kondo)
	* Tile roof above mud substrate
		* Super **HEAVY** roof --> need good structural supports
		* Eaves extend well beyond the building --> need special bracket sets to support
## Kasuga Shrine
* Rice granary style
* 768
* Advanced timber frame architecture
* Rests on wooden frame instead of stone foundation
## Izumo Shrine
* 3 times the size of Ise's main shrine
* Rice granary style
* Founded 7th century
* Pillars rest on foundation stones to slow decay
* Bark roof
* Renewal cycle was 60 years
* Last renewal was in 1744 and then in 2013 (same time as Ise Shrine)
