* Prince Shotoku (574-622)
	* Member of Soga clan (built Asukadera) and Imperial Regent
	* Founds Ikarugadera Temple in 607, rebuilt after a 670 fire as Horyuji
	* Eventually deified as the Founding Father of Buddhism in Japan

	* Golden Hall (Kondo)
	* Five-Story Pagoda
	* Middle Gate
	* Lecture Hall
	* Sutra Repository
	* Belfry

# The Golden Hall (Kondo) From the Outside In
* **Mokoshi (Pent Roof)**
	* Added sometime early during the early 8th century
	* Provides extra support to the eaves via struts
	* Primarily added for structural reasons
	* Mokoshi not always added for structural reasons
* Two-step bracket sets
	* Caused the long eaves to start sagging --> probably needed three-step bracket sets
* Double hip-and-gable roof
	* Second story is false --> doesn't have a floor
		* This type of element is unique to Japan
			* Adoption of architecture from other places in East Asia but syntax is different (different purposes)
		* Facade to make the building look more grand
		* Could be thought of as an architectural sculpture
	* Roof truss extended to the height of two stories (above the first floor)
* **Style**
	* The pitch of the roof
		* Two types of planes
			* Top roof has a very steep pitch starting at the ridgepole that levels out
			* Bottom roof looks like an extension of the flattened plane of the top roof
	* Cloud brackets
		* Used for support and ornamentation
		* Has a cloud-like form (curves and bevels)
		* Convey a sense that the building is wreathed in clouds (like a palace in the sky) --> weightless and doesn't need supports to hold it up

# The Golden Hall (Kondo) From the Inside Out
* The Program in Architecture
	* Middle Gate for people to enter
	* Pagoda where relics are worshiped
	* Lecture Hall where people gather
	* Golden Hall where icon is enshrined
		* Ritual icon (the thing that worship is directed towards): The Buddha Shakyamuni
			* The Buddha
				* Siddhartha Gautama, later known as the Buddha ("the awakened one"), born sometime ca. 563 BCE in Nepal
				* Also later known as Shakyamuni or "Sage of the Shakyas," as he was born into the Shakya clan
				* Leaves home in 30s on journey to enlightenment
			* Before Buddhism
				* Brahmanical tradition in North India and Vedic sacrificial religion
				* Karma: law of causality; consequences might not materialize until a later life
				* Samsara: endless cycle of rebirth
			* Buddhist Teachings
				* Human existence is characterized by dissatisfaction resulting from false attachments (Life is change!)
				* This condition results from the karma of previous lives, and humans are destined to repeat this condition in samsara
				* There is a way to liberate oneself from samsara and achieve nirvana ("extinction") through certain forms of spiritual thought and practice
			* Cave shrines don't really exist in Japan
			* Circumambulation
				* Walking clockwise around a sacred object to generate good karma
		* The Guest-Host Model
			* Have something that is focus of ritual
			* Empty outside of ritual context
			* Icon is animated during ritual but empty after
		* Placement of the south-facing ritual icon in the moya
		* An inscription on the back of the mandorla states that the Shaka statue was created in 623 CE, so most likely served as an icon at Ikarugadera
			* Looks small in the Golden Hall (probably meant for a smaller hall)
		* Canopy ("parasol") designates a high-ranking individual (icon)
		* Hisashi used for circumambulation (embedded into design of Golden Hall)
		* Upper parts of the wall used for semi-partitioning
			* Flying apsaras (celestial beings) painted on the upper walls are circumambulating the icon
		* **Cosmology:**
			* Mount Sumeru
				* The center of Buddhist cosmology, at the peak of which the Buddha resides symbolized by the dais underneath the ritual icon
			* Sculpture platform
				* Figures flanking the Buddha
				* Guardian King status guard the Buddha
			* Pure Land
				* A transcendent realm where different kinds of Buddhas presided, and which were believed to be situated in the four cardinal directions from Mount Sumeru
				* Paintings on the interior of the walls of the Golden Hall

# Horyuji Five-Story Pagoda
* Completed in 711 CE, the only building at Horyuji for which a date is known
* Site meant for worship of the Buddha's relics
* From stupa to pagoda
	* Hemispheric dome structure
	* Sanchi Stupa, Madhya Pradesh, India, 1st c CE
	* Pagodas take over the role of stupas in the East
		* Watchtowers are very prestigious in China
* Grand steeple with nine rings at the top of the pagoda
	* Small hemispheric base at the bottom of the steeple
		* Points back to the stupa
		* Can think of the pagoda as the base of the stupa
* At the base of the heart pillar, the Buddha's relics are buried
	* Mirror
* Shinbashira ("heart pillar")
	* Heart pillar inserted directly into the ground at Horyuji
	* Base of the heart pillar decayed --> replaced later in Horyuji's restoration
	* Tree used for the heart pillar taken in the early 590s
		* Might have been reused from the Asukadera temple
