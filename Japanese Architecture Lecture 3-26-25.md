# Azuchi Castle, 1579
* Oda Nobunga's Azuchi Castle establishes the typology of the Japanese castle, which replaces more simple forts

# 3 Castle Components
1. Foundation
2.  Keep (Tenshu)
3.  Palace (Goten)

# Castle Architecture After Azuchi
* Azuchi-Momoyama Period (1568-1615)
* Until 1582
	* Shift from fort to castle, invention of tenshu tower at Nobunga's Azuchi Castle (1579)
* 1582-98
	* Development of Azuchi castle model by Hideyoshi, most notably Osaka Castle (1585)
* 1598-1615
	* Amidst tension between Toyotomi and Tokugawa families, spread of castles throughout Japan
* 1615 Onward
	* Tokugawa shoguns limit castle construction to one castle per domain (around 260), resulting in the dismantling of many structures

# Himeji Castle
* Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture
* Built between 1601 and 1609 by the daimyo lord Ikeda Terumasa (1564-1613), a son-in-law of the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu
* It was the 4th largest castle built in Japan and the largest to survive, although currently only around a fourth of the surface area of the original structure
* ## Approach
	* Essentially on flat ground --> stone wall foundation takes place of the low-lying hill (former ways of elevation) of earlier castles; need more defensive fortifications on approach to the castle
	* Invaders need to go through a bunch of courtyards and zig-zags
	* Walls have arrow slits
* ## The Tenshu (Tower)
	* Stone wall foundations much more advanced than those of Azuchi
	* Like all castles, basic principles modeled upon Azuchi Castle, but the tower (tenshu) is separate from the palace. The palace portion does not survive
	* The tower (tenshu) is different from Azuchi in the fact that it was not meant for habitation; not adorned with paintings; was connected to 3 small turrets; its emphasis on white plaster and prominent use of curved gables
	* The main tower (tenshu) measures 46.34 meters from the base of its stone foundation to its ridgepole
	* White plaster covers the walls, bracket sets, rafters, and window grills, and functions as a fire retardant
	* The facade is marked by many gables
	* 5 external stories and 7 actual floors
	* The tower of Himeji Castle is surrounded by 3 small towers that are all connected to each other by roofed corridors, generating a complex overall appearance
	* Notable details: ridgepole ornaments (in the shape of aquatic creatures)
* ## High-Rise Engineering
	* When Himeji Castle was conserved from 1956-64, it was discovered that its main tower was supported by 2 enormous vertical pillars that ran continuously from foundation to ridgepole. Not like "heart pillars," more akin to the pillars of the Great Buddha Style
	* The Cusped Gable
		* Used by warriors as a sign of authority

# Kyoto as a Castle Town
* Njio Castle (1626)
* Today:
	* The original keep burned down in 1750 and was never rebuilt; only the 
	  "Second Palace" (Ninomaru) survives from the original 17th century complex
* The 3 Unifiers
	* Oda Nobunaga (1534-82)
		* Takes command of Kyoto in 1568, proceeds to "fill" it in
		* Turns Kyoto into a castle town by building Nijo Castle for the last shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki in 1569 but builds his own castle outside in Azuchi
	* Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536-98)
		* Rebuilds Imperial Palace, districts for aristocrats, temples, commoners
		* Builds own castle, Jurakudai, in Kyoto
		* Great castle builder: Osaka Castle (1585), Jurakudai (1587), Fushimi (1594)
		* Builds wall around Kyoto
		* Builds Great Buddha Hall at Hokoji
	* Tokugawa Ieyasu (1542-1616)
		* Has himself appointed shogun in 1603
		* Build a new capital in Edo
		* Also rebuilt Nijo Castle in 1603 as his own part-time residence in Kyoto, but never came back
		* At the time, Nijo Castle only had one palace, called the Honmaru (First) Palace
	* Tokugawa Iemitsu (1604-1651)
		* Was the grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu
		* Hosted Emperor GoMizuno'o at Nijo Castle for 5 days in 1626
		* For the occasion, he built a Second Palace (Ninomaru)
* The Ninomaru (Second) Palace
	* Consists of 5 main buildings that are all rectangular with tiled, hip-and-gable roofs
	* All are connected and laid out according to a zig-zag pattern
	* Interior designed according to the principles of "monumental shoin architecture"
	* All walls and ceilings ornamented, wall paintings overseen by the shogunal painter-in-attendance Kano Tan'yu (1602-74)
	* Hierarchy of the feudal order built into the design through paintings and floor height; could only enter so far depending on your status
	* Interior features:
		* Elevated floors to differentiate hierarchy
		* Paintings and Architecture
	* Grand Audience Hall (Ohiroma)
		* Begins with Hideyoshi's Osaka Castle (1585)
	* Main buildings:
		* Reception Hall
		* Formal Vestibule
		* Grand Audience Hall
		* Informal Audience Hall
		* Inner Hall
* Togudo (Hall of Eastern Salvation)
* Dojinsai (Room of Mutual Benevolence)
