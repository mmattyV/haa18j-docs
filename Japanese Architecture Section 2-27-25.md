# Describing Architecture Style
* Grammar vs. Style
	* Grammar is the interface (we have them on all different types of buildings); style is the specific implementation (variations)
	* E.g. bracket sets are grammar; cloud bracket sets are style
* Example for Horyuji Golden Hall:
	* Thick timber components and less dramatic curves --> archaic and solemn
* Example for Great South Gate, Todaiji
	* Great Buddha Style
		* 9-step bracket sets
		* Penetrating tie beams that go straight through the pillars --> becomes part of the bracket sets because they extend so far out
		* Horizontal tie beams that the the bracket sets
		* Hidden rafters (piece of horizontal wood hiding)
		* Looks like grid structure
		* Radial rafters
		* Impression: austere, monumental
* Example for Engakuji, Relic Hall, Kamakura, early 15th c.
	* Zen Style
		* Bunched bracket sets
		* Wavy transoms
		* More curves (doors and rafters too)
			* Rafters look like tusks or hedgehog spines
		* More sculptural building
		* 2 tail rafter + 1 bracket arm structure common
		* Includes space under mokoshi into the building
			* More open feel
			* Space partitioned partially with some infilling between the upper parts of the columns
		* Roof exposed (can see the bracket sets)
		* Mirror ceiling that marks the location of the relic
		* More ornamentation and curves --> not as austere
		* Impression: lightness, movement, dynamic
* Example for Phoenix Hall, Byodoin, 1053
	* Great Buddha is 1200s
	* Zen is 1300s
	* Japanese Style
		* Shinden: reticulated shutters, covered corridors
* Example for Kinkakuji, 1397 (1950-1955 reconstruction after fire)
	* Multiple styles --> eclectic
	* 1st and 2nd floors have the same floor plan
	* Cypress bark shingle roofs
	* 1st floor is shinden style
		* 5x4 bays
		* Veranda that opens into the pond
		* Large central area inside
		* Has extra long bays
	* 2nd floor is traditional Japanese style
	* 3rd floor is zen style
		* Bell shaped windows
		* Carved nosings (also in Great Buddha style)
