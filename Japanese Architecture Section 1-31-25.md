# Questions for Week One Section (Ise)

* Why was the rice granary the architectural prototype of the shrines at Ise, and for Japanese shrines in general?
* Take a close look at the elevations, ground or floor plan, and projection for the Inner (or Main) Shrine. Why is the floor of the shrine elevated? And why the forked finials and cylindrical billets? In the floor plan, at either end of the rectangle you will see two circles, indicating two columns. What purpose did they originally serve? How about the two sets of four small almost needle-like projections on either side of the gable ends, visible in the projection diagram? What purpose does the metalwork at the ends of some of the timber components serve? How does the Inner Shrine differ from other shrine buildings at Ise?
* What is the purpose/function of Ise? Who or what is enshrined there? What is your understanding through it of Shinto and the nature of kami deities? How is the site important to the meaning and experience of the shrines?
* What are the materials of the main shrine? How rapidly do they decay?
* Coaldrake discusses three factors in considering the reasons for the twenty-year rebuilding cycle at Ise: architectural, religious, and political. Be prepared to discuss each of these.
	* **Architectural:** wooden structures naturally decay; rebuilding ensures continuity
	* **Religious:** rebirth and purity; cycle reflects nature's impermanence; reinforces Shinto beliefs; transmission of building methods once per generation
	* **Political:** association of rebuilding with the imperial family; status symbol (have the money); affirm connection to the divine
* We ended Week One’s discussion by introducing the notion that a building can have a metabolism. What are the general factors that condition a given structure’s metabolism? How is it affected by human inhabitation, or by social/communal practices related to the building?
* How do the details of Izumo Shrine differ from those of Ise’s Inner Shrine?
* Why is it useful to study the shrines at Ise in relation to Izumo Shrine? What is the history of the Izumo Shrine? How does Coaldrake describe the “different approach to monumentality” between Ise and Izumo?
