# Review (Shinden Architecture)
* Shinden palace, Heian period (794-1185)
* Cypress bark shingle roofs
* All buildings connected by roof corridors
* Its furnishings are occasion specific
* Support pillars planted directly into the ground
* Semi-partitioning important (curtains, screens)

# Innovation in Temple Architecture
* Medici Chapel, Michaelangelo
* What are the norms? (of Japanese temples?)
	* Image hall has the icon of worship
* What do we think about agency?
* Golden Hall, Toshodaiji Monastery, Nara, c. 780s had bracket set innovations (bunched together)
	* Innovations of early temples were uncertain (were they actually innovations?)
* ## Byodo-in and Innovation
	* Changes in belief and practice (changing relationship of worshippper to icon)
	* Pictorial Imagination (based upon a picture)
	* Intermedia (increasing role of painting and sculpture)
		* More fused into the design
	* Artisanal Intelligence (evolving mastery of grammar of wood architecture)
		* 4 zones increasingly mastered and more exceptions
		* Intelligence based off of knowledge of material and past experience

# An Introduction to Byodo-in
* 1053, Uji (south of Kyoto)
* Amida Hall
	* Popular in Heian period
	* Worship Amida Buddha
	* AKA "The Phoenix Hall"
		* The birds adorn each side of the ridgepole
	* Chosen for model at World Expo
* Setting:
	* Part of very large complex adjacent to the Uji River
	* Oriented from west to east because of the icon of worship
	* Pond in front of the hall amplifies the place as a palace of worship for the Amida Buddha
		* Reflects the temple

# Pure Land Buddhism
* Encouraged by belief in mappo, or "Latter Days of the Dharma"
* Based upon worship of the Amitabha Buddha, who vowed to bring salvation to all sentient beings
* Resided in Sukhavati or Western Pure Land located in the westernmost region of the world, where worshippers would be reborn in order to achieve enlightenment --> not at enlightenment but a step on the way there
* Based on visualizations and the practice of nenbustu, or the repetitive chanting of his name
	* To always keep him in mind
	* Also visualization practices to see the pure land
	* These things help keep the mind focused during prayer and meditation
* In Japan, belief in Pure Land Buddhism spread through teachings of monk Genshin (942-1017) and his text Essentials of Salvation of 985, which described heaven and hell and deathbed rituals for Amitabha's "welcoming descent"
	* In your final moments, if you were mindful enough of the Amida Buddha, he will come down and take you to the Pure Land
* Emerges in 6th century China and appears in Horyuji Golden Hall
* More imagery of hell during this period (fire, torture by demons)

# The Amida Hall
* Grand temple construction to house the Amida Buddhas (there's a lot of them)
	* Different grades of Buddhas and the Pure Land based on different grades of spirituality
* Fujiwara no Michinaga (966-1028)
	* Represents the height of Fujiwara power; father to four sitting empresses and uncle or grandfather to five emperors
	* Served as regent, and his reign is recorded in the chronicle Tale of Flowering Fortunes
	* Hojoji, a grand temple-complex built by Michinaga in his later years (completed in 1022), served as a typological precedent for Byodo-in, especially its Amida Hall (1020) known as Muryoju-in
	* Succeeded by his son Fujiwara no Yorimichi, who builds Byodo-in in 1053

# The Exterior
* The design of Byodo-in is derived from a picture -- the Pure Land Mandala
	* Tries to recreate it in 3D architecture
* 3 parts:
	* Rectangular main temple building
		* Has a mokoshi or pent-roof
		* 3x2 bay rectangular building
		* Interior bay has a raised mokoshi roof line
		* Double rafters
	* Roof corridors on each side
	* Tail corridor
	* None of these parts connected in a structural way; they are free-standing and independent; retains image of continuity
* Roof corridors have a balcony and a turret at the end
	* Balconies and floors are not real but are meant for grandeur and ornamentation
* ## The Mokoshi
	* Pent-roof inserted into the main pillars
	* Has its own, thinner pillars
	* Transforms image of the building with its thin pillars
		* Adds variety, levity, and elegance to the building
	* Use for aesthetic reasons goes back to other structures as well
	* At the corner where the mokoshi meets the main pillars:
		* The beams that support the mokoshi are octagonal (chamfering)
			* Adds impression of even thinner components --> increased levity and elegance
		* Chamfering even in rafters in the roof

# The Interior
* Main Hall is 3x2 bays with mokoshi
* Moya without hisashi
* Raised platform for the Amida Buddha icon
	* Compact on the inside
	* Share more intimate space with the icon
	* Icon made with joined woodblock construction (looks like Legos)
		* Thin wooden shell and hollow cavity
		* Inside the sculpture:
			* A lotus seat with a Buddhist incantation in Sanskrit characters
* Partitioning of the interior present
* Double-coffered ceiling that covers the underside of the eaves
* Icon sitting on a lotus seat facing outwards
	* Parasol above the sculpture looks like swirling clouds --> more descent imagery (mandorla)
* Walls have 52 Bodhisattvas
	* All on cloud pedestals --> in motion
* Amida's Welcoming Descent:
	* Doors might have had welcoming descent paintings
	* Interior represents the welcoming descent through painting, sculpture, cloud imagery, and splendor
* Can view the icon through a shutter from across the pond
* Architecture complements both viewing from the inside and outside

# Conclusion
* Byodo-in and Innovation:
	* Changes in Belief and Practice
		* Now imagining icon in the Pure Land; Welcoming Descent
	* Intermedia
		* Fusion of paintings, sculptures, the icon to conjure the Welcoming Descent
	* Artisanal Intelligence
		* Vision had to be realized with innovative artisans
