# Old (ex. Horyuji) vs. New Timber Architecture (ex. Yakushiji East Pagoda)
* Late 7th century vs. early 8th century
* ## Bracket sets
	* Bearing block directly connects to the horizontal piece on top
		* Connects to bracket arm
	* Evolution of bracket set design
		* Horyuji: 2-set
		* Yakushiji: 3-set
		* Toshodaiji vs. Yakushiji: bracket sets became more complex and compact over time
* Yakushiji has coffered ceiling
* ## Toshodaiji
	* Hisashi outside
	* Walk directly into the moya
	* Open colonnade portico (kind of like Widener)
* ## Horyuji Golden Hall
	* Have to walk inside to see hisashi and moya

# Imperial Capitals
* ## Kyoto (794-1868)
	* Grid layout
		* Drawing from Chinese capital design (Chang'an, imperial capital of Tang dynasty 618-907)
		* Emperor and palace in daidairi
		* Daidairi is in the north and is south-facing
			* Represents Polaris - stays in one place while everyone moves around it --> the emperor
			* Emperor is the son of heaven
		* Middle avenue is called the Red Phoenix Boulevard
			* Helps divide city into 4 quadrants
		* Capital cities on the continent had walls but Kyoto didn't
			* Would allow for urban drift - people can move around the city more
			* In Kyoto:
				* People moved from west to east of the city because:
					* More humid and uninhabitable than the east side
					* Less developed than the east side because of resource constraints
		* Only 2 state temples in the city
			* To reduce religious influence in the city
				* In Nara, one ambitious monk rose in influence and had eyes for the throne
			* Also further south to separate from the palace
		* Grid is hierarchical
			* Closer to daidairi --> more important

# Tale of Genji
* ## Shinden Architecture
	* 4 zones of timber architecture:
		* Foundation - shinden does not have (pillars go straight into the ground; like Ise)
		* Pillars - shinden has; post and lintel structure
		* Bracket Sets - shinden does not have
		* Roofs - shinden uses cypress bark shingle roofs
	* Occassion-specific furnishings
		* Architecture is blank canvas
		* Modify interior for event of the day using partitioning (blinds, curtains, sliding doors, mats)
	* "The Flute"
		* Left painting (landscape) is a sliding door
		* Sliding door left ajar --> Yugiri just came in
		* Yugiri is the guy on the left of the middle pillar; hand on the pillar; not really in the same space
		* Wife is inside the main chamber
		* Women have long, flowing hair
