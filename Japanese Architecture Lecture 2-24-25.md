# Style in Japanese Temple Architecture
* ## Architecture Style
	* Can be differentiated by: bracket sets, filler between support pillars, ceilings
	* Greater than sum of its parts
	* Relational - comparative
	* Categories often conceived by later historians
	* Some stylistic categories are defined by absence
	* **The Japanese Style (Wayo):** temple architecture in and around the Heijo and Heian capitals up through the 12th century
	* **The Great Buddha Style (Daibutsuyo):** Develops around 1200 under Chinese influence
	* **The Zen Style (Zenshuyo):** Develops in 13th century under Chinese influence
* ## The Great Buddha Style (Daibutsuyo)
	* **Todaiji Monastery:**
		* Built by Emperor Shomu in mid 8th century
		* Hard to date - likes a college campus (buildings built at different times)
		* Great Buddha consecrated in 752 CE
		* Great Buddha Hall built ca. 757
		* Great South Gate ca. 762
		* Much of monastery destroyed by fire due to Genpei War in 1180
		* Why was Todaiji and its main icon so monumental?
			* Center of national network of temples
			* Served as a second Grand Hall of State
			* Enshrines the Cosmic Buddha Vairocana (Flower Garland Sutra)
				* Existed throughout all time
				* If the Buddha attained enlightenment in the 5th century BCE, then buddhist teachings must have existed before his time --> establishment of a primordial buddha
				* East asian rulers liked using the Cosmic Buddha as a metaphor of their rule (rule over multiple realms)
				* Presides over all buddhist worlds --> its statue is really big
			* Lineage of colossal buddhas throughout Asia
		* Colossal Buddhas were being constructed around the same time as Todaiji
		* Entire campus surrounded by roofed corridors
		* Great Buddha Hall (Daibutsuden)
			* Original structure dates to circa 757
			* Destroyed by fire in 1180, rebuilt in 1195
			* Destroyed again by fire in 1567, rebuilt in 1709 (current)
			* Currently 7 bays wide, 30 percent smaller than first 2 versions (11 bays wide)
			* When the Great Buddha Hall was rebuilt in 1195 by Chogen, many changes were made both structurally and aesthetically to accommodate monumental construction
			* Chogen (1121-1206): buddhist monk who oversees reconstruction of Todaiji
				* Represents diminishing of the authority of the imperium in Japan
				* Rebuilds entire complex in Great Buddha Style
		* Great South Gate (1203)
			* 2-story building
			* 5x2 bays in dimension
			* Over 25m in height and almost 30m in width
			* Double hip-and-gable roof
			* Bays on either side of facade are filled in with wood grills and walls
			* Nio: Guardian Deities
				* 8 meters tall
				* Created in 1203
				* Fierce expression to protect from evil spirits
			* First version (ca. 762) was built like a pagoda, with separate pillars for lower and upper stories
			* Was structurally flawed, was twice damaged by typhoons in 962 and 989
			* The challenge for Chogen was how to build a stable but high-rise gateway that served as an appropriately monumental gateway for the temple
			* The resulting structure relied on 2 elements previously unwitnessed in Japan:
				* Penetrating tie-beams
					* Lots of horizontal tie beams that penetrate straight through the main support pillars
					* Non-penetrating tie beams go around the pillars
					* Great Buddha Style: penetrating tie-beams
					* Japanese Style: non-penetrating tie-beams
					* Requires innovation in tools and woodworking techniques
					* Only works with massive pillars
				* Massive bracket sets
					* 9-step bracket sets
					* Largest bracket sets in East Asia, brackets continue up underside of eaves
					* Eaves project over 5 meters beyond the wall plane
					* Outer ends of tie-beams form part of bracket sets
					* Brackets themselves face only front to back-lateral arms missing
					* Continuous horizontal tie-beams run parallel to walls of building to brace projecting bracket arms (usually horizontal tie-beams only one bay in width, here much longer)
			* Other features
				* Distinctive nosings (curves introduced at the ends of the tie beams)
				* Ends of rafters covered by horizontal beams
				* Radial raftering - angled gradually to complement the 45 degree angle of the corner
* ## Zen Style Architecture
	* Introduced from China during the 13th century
	* Associated initially with Zen monasteries in Japan
	* Characterized by prevalence of non-structural elements in building's design, introducing greater sense of motion, curvature, and sculptural qualities
	* Examples: Relic Hall (Shariden) at Engakuji Monastery
	* **History of Zen Buddhism:**
		* Originates in China; it's semi-legendary founder is an Indian monk named Bodhidharma
	* Zen monasteries:
		* Strong north to south alignment of the buildings - strong vertical access
		* They included new types of buildings such as Dharma Halls, Meditation Halls, and Abbot's Quarters
		* Relics were enshrined in relic halls instead of pagodas
		* In a relic hall, the relic replaced a status of a buddhist deity as the thing of worship
	* Relic Hall at Engakuji, Kamakura, early 15th century
		* From the Outside-in:
			* Good example of Zen Style (except for cedar shingle roof)
			* 3x3 bay building with hip-and-gable roof
			* It has a mokoshi (pent roof) whose facade plays an important role in its stylistic appearance
			* Floor plan
				* Front 2 pillars in moya are missing
			* Bunched intercolumnar bracket sets (small, between pillars, looks like bunch of grapes)
			* Wavy transom gives sense of motion
			* Cusped windows
			* Hinged door panels with grills
			* Carved foundation stones
			* Shrimp tie-beams
			* **Very wavy and curved style!**
			* Tail rafters look like tusks
		* From the Inside-out
			* 1x1 bay moya with hisashi and mokoshi
			* Front 2 pillars of the moya are removed, north (back) side walled in
				* Space has to be spanned from front to back with large, two-bay-long transverse beams
			* Otherwise all full partitioning
			* Incorporation of the mokoshi into the interior
			* Hisashi is semi-partitioned with wooden planks on the upper portion of the bay
			* Reliquary
				* In the moya, the Buddha's relic is enshrined within a reliquary
			* Shrimp tie-beams - look like shrimp
			* Mirror ceiling
			* Brackets sets fully articulated on the interior as well
			* Curved foundation stones
* ## The Japanese Style (Wayo)
	* Qualities:
		* Modest scale, mostly hip-and-gable roofs
		* 3-step bracket sets
		* Non-penetrating tie-beams
		* Coffered ceilings and plaster walls
		* Use of mokoshi to aestheticize profile
