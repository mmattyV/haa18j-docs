# Tiebeams
* Horizontal beans between the pillars
* Used to brace the pillars laterally to give them rigidity
* Gable-side beams and facade-side beams have different functions
* Spanning happens along width of building
	* Spanning removes pillars

# Bracket Sets
* Each bracket arm and tail rafter counts as a step
* **Tail rafter** acts like a seesaw
	* Middle like a fulcrum
	* Weight of building pushes down on the inner end --> outer end lifts up (keeping the outer eaves up)

# Roof
* Hip-and-gable roof usually has 2 perimeters of columns
	* Where the hip meets the gable is where we have the inner loop of columns

# Horyuji Pagoda
* Central pillar has sympodial structure
	* Bracket sets
* Core pillar still used as a lateral bracing mechanism (against earthquakes and high winds)
	* Flexes
	* Sometimes swings in opposite direction of the rest of the building
	* Swings less than the rest of the structure
