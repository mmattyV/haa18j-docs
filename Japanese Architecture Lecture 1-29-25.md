## Ise Shrine
* Shinto gods
* Built to worship the Sun Goddess Amaterasu
	* Most important god
	* Ancestor of the ruling party (imperial family was divine)
* Only major shrine from imperial era to continue renewal
* Imperial shrine
* Became a popular pilgrimage site
* **Renewal**
	* Renewed/rebuilt from the ground up every 2 decades
		* Happened since the late 7th century
	* All 125 shrines, ancillary buildings, fences, bridges are rebuilt
	* All the treasures, vestments, building tools are renewed
	* Takes 8 years to renew everything
	* Atsuta Shrine receives the old timber from Ise after each renewal
	* Rebuilt with the same design and architecture each time
	* The buildings begin to age almost immediately (wood changes color, thatch begins to rot) --> shows that architecture has a *metabolism*
* **Ise Complex**
	* 5 km spanning the Inner Sanctuary (Amaterasu) and the Outer Sanctuary (Toyouke)
	* Inner Sanctuary has 2 courtyards oriented N-S
		* At any one time, one of the courtyards will contain the main shrine
		* Other one will be empty (fallow) - has a little shelter containing the heart pillar of the last shrine
	* Shrine courtyard has the main shrine with the 2 treasuries to the north
* **Architectural Qualities**
	* Rectangular wooden building
	* 3x2 **bays**
		* Bays are the areas between 2 pillars
	* Gable thatch roof
		* 2 planes meeting at the apex
	* Raised floor raised up by pillars (pillars planted directly in the ground)
	* About 3 stories high
	* Roof has forked finials (extend from the roof)
		* Covered with bronze
		* Has 2 notches
	* Cylindrical billets laid perpendicular along the roof (tapered at the end) on the ridge pole
		* The number of the billets determines the importance of the building
	* Either gable end has a free-standing pillar (comes up to the ridge pole)
		* Ridge pole bearing
	* The apex of the gable has 4 pegs at either end of the building
		* No structural role
	* Lots of bronze ornamentation
	* Bracket sets support the structure
		* No nails are used --> allows joinery to be loose and flexible during earthquakes
		* Not Ikea
		* Very precise
	* Hard vs. soft architecture
		* Permanent vs. temporary
		* Ise Shrine is a bit of both
	* Line symmetries imposed on the landscape; N-S; twin courtyards
		* Inspired by Chinese and Korean influence
		* Ornamentation comes from continental crafts
	* **Materials**
		* Wood from Japanese cypress (Hinoki)
		* When freshly cut, has a creamy, monochrome appearance
		* Miscanthus reed (Kaya) - used for the roof
	* **The Rice Granary as Model**
		* Ise Shrine is based off of the neolithic rice granary
			* Rectangular wooden building
			* Raised floor
				* Protects from flooding and pests
			* Thatch gable roof
		* Food = power
			* Might have led to people raising the structure to a sacred level
		* Billets could've provided weight to improve stability
		* Function inspired the architecture (even though it may no longer be needed)
	* **Religious Context**
		* Shinto and Kami worship
		* Shinto is the worship of Kami
		* Kami are very high maintenance --> need to constantly be appeased by humans; prone to outbursts
		* Sacred ropes mark where the sacred grounds are
		* Torii Gate
			* Marks the boundary to a sacred zone
	* **Historical Context**
		* Late 7th century:
			* Jinshin War (672)
			* The establishment of Emperor Temmu's reign (d. 686)
			* The first use of the name "Nihon" (from which "Japan" derives)
			* Formalization of the Ise compound
			* Toyouke, the deity of the Outer Sanctuary, and many of the 125 total deities reflect a political alliance with other clans (deities of the allied clans)
	* **Interregional Context**
		* East Asian region:
			* Establishment of the Tang dynasty in 618 CE
			* Establishment of the Unified Silla dynasty in 668 CE
			* Japan's adoption of the Ritsuryo Code ca. 700 CE

## Architecture as Process
* In most cases, a building's architecture is described by its outward appearance
* In Ise's case, its meaning is derived from the way it is built
* The steps of rebuilding Ise allow the entire community to participate in its ongoing-ness
	* Ex. log-dragging ceremony
	* Shared cultural memory

## Architectural Metabolism
* Commonly thought that the renewal process has something to do with its materials
* Renewal doesn't have to do with lifespan of its materials
* Lifespan of a building has to do with whether its inhabited and maintained
* The only part of the wood that's decayed is the part that's in the ground
* Ise is built in a way to speed up the decay of the building
	* More advanced forms of architecture that protect the wood were already present around the same time as Ise
