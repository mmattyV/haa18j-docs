# Japanese Carpenter Tools
* Over 80 different types of tools --> more variations of wood joinery
* More tools than any other craftsmanship traditions
* Japanese carpenters pull with their tools --> control over force
* High-carbon steel on the outside --> sharp and hard
	* Laminated over low-carbon steel on the inside --> more malleable and flexible
* As a carpenter's apprentice, your first 3 years are sharpening your master's tools
* Paid attention to the grain and curvature of the wood:
	* Different qualities depending on where the tree is from
	* Did it grow in the sun or the shadow?
	* West, east, south, or north?
	* Different woods for different parts of the building
* Carpenters had the overall plan in mind --> more leeway in dimension and scale of building

* Paintings on doors
	* Represent 9 grades of rebirth (3 divisions: upper, middle, and lower rebirth)
